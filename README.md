We use `npm`.

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install`, start a development server:

1. Documentation development

```bash
npm run dev:docs
```

2. SUI Component development

```bash
npm run dev
```

\*Before you commit, make sure that `npm run check` to check your change with Svelte-Kit.
