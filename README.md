This is going to be a Svelte UI library that anyone can contribute and improve/propel Svelte community!

# Are You Ready?

We use `pnpm`.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `pnpm install`, start a development server:

1. Documentation development

```bash
pnpm run dev:docs
```

2. SUI Component development

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

\*Before you commit, make sure that `pnpm run check` to check your change with Svelte-Kit.
