## 1. Before you install

Before you install S-UI into your project, make sure that your project is based on Svelte/Svelte Kit.
(You don't need to install Tailwind CSS at all, however our project is built with Tailwind CSS.)

### For Svelte

You can initiate your Svelte project with the following code.

```
npm create vite@latest myapp -- --template svelte
cd myapp
```

### For Svelte Kit

You can initiate your Svelte Kit project with the following code.

```
npm create svelte@latest my-app
cd my-app
```

## 2. Let's install S-UI

To install S-UI into your project, we need to run this command.

```
npm i -D s-ui
```

## 3. You are ready!

You are pretty much ready to use S-UI! Let's take a look at each component so we can understand <Link href="/components/button">how to use them</Link>!
